/*
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is required to take the attributes of a student and transform them into an object. Then it will use the new student object to populate a roster array of students. It will preform a check on the student emails to verify they are valid. Finally it will allow the removal of added students via the remove function to delete a student ID.
